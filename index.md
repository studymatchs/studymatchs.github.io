## Milestone 1

For the first milestone, our goal was to create the basic pages and components needed to operate the site. To start, we used the Digits program as a template for the program due to having much of the needed components. From there, Rex edited the landing page and the project's theme to suit the goal.

A user landing page, from now on knownas the welcome page, is set up to include information for the user, like their classmates, their classes, and a list of upcoming events.

Jui-chen worked on a page to add classmates that are in the user's class. It currently uses the Contacts system in the Digits application, but further functionality would be added later on.
