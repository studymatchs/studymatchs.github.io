## [Milestone 1](https://github.com/studymatchs/StudyMatchs/projects/2)

For the first milestone, our goal was to create the basic pages and components needed to operate the site. To start, we used the Digits program as a template for the program due to having much of the needed components. From there, Rex edited the landing page and the project's theme to suit the goal.

A user landing page, from now on knownas the welcome page, is set up to include information for the user, like their classmates, their classes, and a list of upcoming events.

Jui-chen worked on a page to add classmates that are in the user's class. It currently uses the Contacts system in the Digits application, but further functionality would be added later on.

He also modified the List Contacts page to display classmates. At the moment, it still relies on much of the Contacts framework in Digits.

James worked on the message system. The goal of a message system is to allow the users to engage in a message board to get help, even if they cannot meet in person for a study group.

## [Milestone 2](https://github.com/studymatchs/StudyMatchs/projects/3)

In the second milestone, we intend to create backend functionality by creating an appropriate database and operational pages that use said database. With that in mind, By the end of this milestone, users that create accounts should be able to add classes to their profiles, then be automatically added to a list of users that shate the same class. Users should also be able to create schedules and view the profiles of their classmates.

## [Milestone 3](https://github.com/studymatchs/StudyMatchs/projects/4)

In the third milestone, we intend to implement the administrator capabilities by implementing admin functions, such as deleting and editing other users and their data. Our main goals are to fully implement admin functionality, testing, and finalizing the UI design. By the end of this milestone, admin users should be able to delete users, messages, and study sessions. They should also be able to edit user profiles.
